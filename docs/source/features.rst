Earning doubloons
=================
Doubloons are earned by completing tasks, stealing them from others, and by just sending messages. The (default)
odds are 1/15 per message sent. There is an antispam feature that prevents you from earning doubloons if you send
messages too quickly. You can earn multiple doubloons at once, if you improve your Doublooning.

You can also lose doubloons to "taxes", or "Red doubloons" if you send messages containing vulgar language.
Taxes were first invented by the server member **Milkyz**.

Tasks
=====
Tasks are a way to earn doubloons. They are available to all members of the server. They are separated into 4 categories:
:guilabel:`SIMPLE`,
:guilabel:`COMPLEX`,
:guilabel:`ADVANCED`, and
:guilabel:`UNIQUE`

These categories determine the difficulty of the task, the length of time it takes to complete it, and the amount of
doubloons you earn from it.

There are two types of tasks: **Normal** and **Malicious**.
**Normal tasks** are the most common ones. In **Malicious tasks**, you try to steal doubloons from other members.

Select a task from your list of tasks. You will how long the task will take, how likely you are to finish it, and the
amount of doubloons you will earn. Next, you will be asked to determine a budget for the task. The more budget you set,
the more likely you are to finish the task. If the task is interrupted, you will not earn any doubloons and you lose all
the doubloons you have spent on the budget.

Then, the task will be started. You can claim the rewards after the task is complete. You can not interrupt a task manually.
